            <h2>Tracing History</h2>
            <p>The people of this clan switched their positions between north and south India many times in the history. The Famous Ganga Vansh (गंग वंश) reported as Western Ganga Dynasty and Eastern Ganga Dynasty of South India were established by the ancestors of this clan.</p>
            <p>“The origin of the Gangas is derived from Iksvaku and trace back to Ayodhyapuri Under Visnugupta the seat of government was moved to Ahichhatra (in Panchalya region near Bareilly), which, it is hinted, as Vijayapura. With the arrival of Dadiga and Madhava in the South, at Ganga-perur and the establishment of the Gangavadi kingdom in Mysore aided by Simhanandi, we seem to come to historical events.”</p>

            <p>People of Western Ganga Dynasty emerged as powerful Rastrakutas (Rashtrakuta Dynasty) and marched towards Kannauj and Kampil in the 9th century AD.It is clear from the copperplate instructions found in 9th century from badaun district that Kampil, Kannauj and Ahichhatra were reclaimed by the Rashtrakutas came from down south.</p>
            <p>Copperplate Instructions of Rastrakuta King Dantavarman [867 AD] in Kampilya, donation of land to the Kampilya vihara where 500 monks of the sangha lived and studied.</p>
            <p>Another Copper plate Instructions of the Rastrakuta King Dharavarsa [884 AD] recording similar grants to Kampilya vihara monestry.</p>

            <h2>Gahrwar Empire</h2>
            <p>Kampil was ruled in 9th century by Rastrakuta kings and later on the social group established a powerful empire in Kannauj as Gaharwar Dynasty around 1050 AD. Copperplate Instructions found in Badaun also confirms that Rastrakutas Kshtraps of this region established a Rathore or Gaharwar empire in Kannauj under the leadership of Buddhist King Chandradeva around 1090 AD.Latter Kings were patron of both Hindu temples and Buddhist monasteries. A grand temple was built by Govindachandra at the birthplace of Bhagwan Shri Ram Chandra in Ayodhya.</p>

            <h2>Medieval Period</h2>
            <p>In the medieval history this clan were soldiers in the army of Shivaji and other Maratha Kshatraps; from known historical facts it is found that they originally belonged to Gaharwar family ruling Kannauj before the invasion of Gori in last decade of 13th century. After this turmoil Gaharwars settled themselves in Swargdwari on the lower bank of Ganga and Marwar. Gaharwars ruled Swargdwari till King Kunwar Rai Singh, better known as Khor left this place and set up a new Gorakha Kingdom in Gorakhpur in Terai region in 1210 A.D. Khor was a disciple of Guru Gorakhnath and lost war against Samsuddin, subedar of Badaun under Qutubuddin Aibak.</p>
            <p>Gangwars never bowed their heads before any Sabja-Parcham or British Flags. They never compromised with the hard earned self respect and decided not to serve any foreign power during entire period of foreign influence over the country. But Joined happily the Maratha Forces.</p>
            <p>Gangwars returned to region with the join the army of Sindhias Holkars in 1751 defeating Afghans and Pathans. After this great victory over Rohilkhand Gangwars decided to settle in this region. Gangwars are Suryavanshi Kshatriyas.</p>

            <p>It was the most important period in the history when Maratha forces advanced in the North and expanded the Empire to the Natural Dimensions of the country. Malharrao Holkar, Jayappa Scindia, Gangadhar Tatya, Tukojirao Holkar, Khanderao Holkar went to help Safdarjung against Shadulla Khan, Ahmed Khan Bangash, Mohamud Khan, Bahadur Khan Rohilla as per the directions of Peshwa Balaji Bajirao. In the Battle of Fategarh and Farrukhabad, they defeated the Rohillas and Bangash (March, 1751-April, 1752).</p>
            <p>As result of this Battle Rohillas were compelled to pay a compensation amount of 30 lakh rupees along with an annual tribute. The amount of tribute was half of the total collections from 33 Mahals of Rohilkhand and Farrukhabad. Rohillas were also forced to pay the total expenses for the management of the troops for Gangwar and Katiyar Maratha sardars stationed at Aliganj and Kannauj respectively. Ahmad Khan continued to pay the amount till the third battle of Panipat in 1761, when the Marathas left Doab.</p>
            <p>Malharrao Holkar, Raghunathrao, Shamsher Bahadur, Gangadhar Tatya, Sakharambapu, Naroshankar and Maujiram Bania attacked Delhi on 11 August 1757 and defeated Najib Khan and Ahmed Khan became the Mir Bakshi in his place. In March, 1758, they conquered Sarhind. On 20 April 1758, Malharrao Holkar and Raghunathrao attacked and conquered Lahore. Tukojirao Holkar conquered Attock.

            <h2>1769-1804</h2>
            <p>In 1969 AD Maratha forces once again crossed Narmada and marched towards north India to penalize Rohillas and Pathans of Rohilkhand and Farrukhabad. This time Maratha forces were led by Malhar Rao Holkar and he was assisted by Mahadaji Shinde. In early 1771, ten years after the collapse of Maratha supremacy in north India in the Third Battle of Panipat, Mahadji recaptured Delhi and restored the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II to the throne in 1772. In the same year he crushed the Rohillas and Pathans in Doab region and captured it. They destroyed Hafiz Rahmat Khan, Ahmed Khan and Zabet Khan completely. Maratha forces completely wiped out the Pathans from this land and established two Maratha colonies to consolidate their claim over this region.</p>
            <p>Gangwar and Katiyar Sardars played a great role in all Maratha Missions of North India and a reward to their services towards Hind Swaraj these people were given the charge of their own homeland lost after Mohammadan intrusion to their region during Mogul period. These colonies were established in two strips. The first strip was dominated by Gangwar Sardars ranging from Kaimganj to Pilibhit and second strip was dominated by Katiyar Sardars ranging from Farrukhabad to Bithur. This dominance continued till the Battle of Farrukhabad fought against British Forces in November 1804 during Second Anglo-Maratha War under the leadership of Yashwantrao Holkar.</p>
            <p>The description of revenge taken by Maratha Sardars is described by Vinayak Damodar Savarkar in his book Hidu-pad-paadshahi</p>
            <p>“The Hindu arms, even without resorting to these barbarous and brutal acts, had struck such terror in the hearts of the Rohillas and Pathans all over the land, that the very sight of a, Maratha trooper was enough to make a whole village of Robilla Moslems take to their heels. Those of their leaders who survived, Bed away to the interior of the forests of Terai. There too it was only the setting in of the rainy season alone that shielded them from the steel of the Maratha vengeance. So terribly had they to pay for Panipat.”</p>

            <h2>Modern Period</h2>
            <p>After the fall of Maratha Supremacy over the country, the population involved themselves completely in agricultural work. The country yielded four crops a year. Orchards of mango, guava and other tropical fruits were also developed by the farmers in due course of time.</p>
            <p>In the post-independence era after the spread out of education to the masses, most of the people joined government services.</p>

            <h2>इतिहास का पता लगाना</h2>
            <p>इस कबीले के लोगों ने इतिहास में कई बार उत्तर और दक्षिण भारत के बीच अपनी स्थिति बदली। प्रसिद्ध गंगा वंश (गंग वंश) को दक्षिण भारत के पश्चिमी गंगा वंश और पूर्वी गंगा वंश के रूप में जाना जाता है, जिसे इस कबीले के पूर्वजों ने स्थापित किया था।</p>
            <p>“गंगाओं की उत्पत्ति इक्ष्वाकु से होती है और अयोध्यापुरी से जुड़ी है। विष्णुगुप्त के अधीन शासन का स्थान अहिच्छत्र (पंचाल्य क्षेत्र के निकट बरेली) स्थानांतरित हुआ, जिसे विजयपुरा भी कहा गया। दादिगा और माधव के दक्षिण में गंगा-पेरुर में आगमन और सिम्हनंदी की मदद से गंगावाड़ी राज्य की स्थापना ऐतिहासिक घटनाओं की ओर संकेत करती है।”</p>
            <p>कुल गौरव गाथा: इतिहास का पता लगाना: इक्ष्वाकु अयोध्या 1500 ई.पू., विष्णुगुप्त अहिक्षेत्र 700 ई.पू., माधव गंगावाड़ी 300 ई.पू., ध्रुव कन्नौज 800 ई., खोर गोरखपुर 1200 ई., गंगाधर पंचाल्य 1751 ई.</p>
            <p>पश्चिमी गंगा वंश के लोग शक्तिशाली राष्ट्रकूटों (राष्ट्रकूट वंश) के रूप में उभरे और 9वीं शताब्दी ईस्वी में कन्नौज और कम्पिल की ओर बढ़े। यह 9वीं शताब्दी के बदायूं जिले से प्राप्त ताम्रपत्र से स्पष्ट होता है कि कम्पिल, कन्नौज और अहिच्छत्र को दक्षिण से आए राष्ट्रकूटों द्वारा पुनः प्राप्त किया गया।</p>
            <p>राष्ट्रकूट राजा दंतेवर्मन [867 ई.] के ताम्रपत्र निर्देश, जिसमें कम्पिल्य विहार को भूमि दान का उल्लेख है, जहां 500 भिक्षु संघ के साथ रहते थे और अध्ययन करते थे।</p>
            <p>राष्ट्रकूट राजा धारवर्ष [884 ई.] के ताम्रपत्र निर्देशों में कम्पिल्य विहार मठ को इसी प्रकार के दान का उल्लेख मिलता है।</p>

            <p>9वीं शताब्दी में कम्पिल पर राष्ट्रकूट राजाओं का शासन था और बाद में इस सामाजिक समूह ने 1050 ईस्वी के आसपास कन्नौज में गहरवार वंश के रूप में एक शक्तिशाली साम्राज्य स्थापित किया। बदायूं में मिले ताम्रपत्र निर्देशों से भी पुष्टि होती है कि इस क्षेत्र के राष्ट्रकूट क्षत्रपों ने 1090 ईस्वी के आसपास बौद्ध राजा चंद्रदेव के नेतृत्व में कन्नौज में राठौड़ या गहरवार साम्राज्य स्थापित किया। बाद के राजाओं ने हिंदू मंदिरों और बौद्ध मठों दोनों का संरक्षण किया। भगवान श्री रामचंद्र के जन्मस्थान अयोध्या में गोविंदचंद्र द्वारा एक भव्य मंदिर बनवाया गया।</p>

            <h2>मध्यकालीन काल</h2>
            <p>मध्यकालीन इतिहास में यह कबीला शिवाजी और अन्य मराठा क्षत्रपों की सेना में सैनिक थे। ज्ञात ऐतिहासिक तथ्यों के अनुसार, यह पाया गया कि वे मूल रूप से 13वीं शताब्दी के अंतिम दशक में गौरी के आक्रमण से पहले कन्नौज पर शासन करने वाले गहरवार परिवार से संबंधित थे। इस उथल-पुथल के बाद गहरवारों ने गंगा के निचले किनारे स्वर्गद्वारी और मारवाड़ में खुद को स्थापित किया। गहरवारों ने स्वर्गद्वारी पर शासन किया जब तक कि राजा कुंवर राय सिंह, जिन्हें खोर के नाम से जाना जाता है, इस स्थान को छोड़कर 1210 ईस्वी में तराई क्षेत्र के गोरखपुर में एक नया गोरखा राज्य स्थापित किया। खोर गुरु गोरखनाथ के शिष्य थे और कुतुबुद्दीन ऐबक के अधीन बदायूं के सूबेदार शम्सुद्दीन के खिलाफ युद्ध हार गए।</p>
            <p>गंगवारों ने कभी किसी सब्जा-पर्चम या ब्रिटिश झंडे के सामने सिर नहीं झुकाया। उन्होंने अपनी कड़ी मेहनत से अर्जित आत्म-सम्मान से कभी समझौता नहीं किया और पूरे विदेशी प्रभाव के दौरान किसी विदेशी शक्ति की सेवा नहीं करने का फैसला किया। लेकिन मराठा बलों में खुशी-खुशी शामिल हो गए।</p>
            <p>गंगवार 1751 में सिंधिया और होल्कर की सेना में शामिल होकर क्षेत्र में लौटे और अफगानों और पठानों को हराया। रोहिलखंड पर इस महान विजय के बाद गंगवारों ने इस क्षेत्र में बसने का निर्णय लिया। गंगवार सूर्यवंशी क्षत्रिय हैं।</p>

            <p>यह इतिहास का सबसे महत्वपूर्ण काल था जब मराठा सेनाओं ने उत्तर में प्रगति की और साम्राज्य को देश के प्राकृतिक आयामों तक विस्तारित किया। मल्हारराव होल्कर, जयप्पा सिंधिया, गंगाधर तात्या, तुकोजीराव होल्कर, खंडेराव होल्कर ने पेशवा बाजीराव बालाजी के निर्देशों के अनुसार शादुल्ला खान, अहमद खान बंगश, मोहम्मद खान, बहादुर खान रोहिल्ला के खिलाफ सफदरजंग की मदद की। फतेगढ़ और फर्रुखाबाद की लड़ाई में उन्होंने रोहिल्लों और बंगशों को हराया (मार्च 1751-अप्रैल 1752)।</p>
            <p>इस लड़ाई के परिणामस्वरूप, रोहिल्लों को 30 लाख रुपये का मुआवजा और एक वार्षिक कर चुकाने के लिए बाध्य किया गया। यह कर रोहिल्लखंड और फर्रुखाबाद के 33 महलों से कुल संग्रह का आधा था। रोहिल्लों को अलीगंज और कन्नौज में तैनात गंगवार और कटियार मराठा सरदारों की सेना प्रबंधन के खर्चे भी चुकाने पड़े। अहमद खान ने 1761 में पानीपत की तीसरी लड़ाई तक यह राशि चुकाई, जब मराठाओं ने दोआब छोड़ दिया।</p>
            <p>11 अगस्त 1757 को मल्हारराव होल्कर, रघुनाथराव, शमशेर बहादुर, गंगाधर तात्या, सखाराम बापू, नारोशंकर और मौजीराम बनिया ने दिल्ली पर हमला किया और नजीब खान को हराया। मार्च 1758 में उन्होंने सरहिंद पर विजय प्राप्त की। 20 अप्रैल 1758 को मल्हारराव होल्कर और रघुनाथराव ने लाहौर पर विजय प्राप्त की। तुकोजीराव होल्कर ने अटक पर कब्जा किया। साबाजी सिंधिया और विट्ठल शिवदेव ने पेशावर में उनसे मुलाकात की। रघुनाथराव और मल्हारराव होल्कर पंजाब से लौट आए।</p>

            <h2>1769-1804</h2>
            <p>1769 ईस्वी में मराठा सेना ने एक बार फिर नर्मदा पार की और रोहिलखंड और फर्रुखाबाद के रोहिल्ला और पठानों को दंडित करने के लिए उत्तर भारत की ओर बढ़ी। इस बार मराठा सेना का नेतृत्व मल्हारराव होल्कर ने किया और महादजी शिंदे ने उनका साथ दिया। 1771 की शुरुआत में, पानीपत की तीसरी लड़ाई के दस साल बाद, महादजी ने दिल्ली पर पुनः कब्जा किया और 1772 में मुगल सम्राट शाह आलम II को सिंहासन पर बहाल किया। उसी वर्ष उन्होंने दोआब क्षेत्र में रोहिल्ला और पठानों को कुचल दिया और इसे जीत लिया।</p>
            <p>गंगवार और कटियार सरदारों ने उत्तर भारत के सभी मराठा अभियानों में बड़ी भूमिका निभाई और हिंद स्वराज के लिए उनकी सेवाओं के बदले में इन्हें उनके गृहनगर की जिम्मेदारी दी गई। ये कॉलोनियां दो पट्टियों में स्थापित की गईं। पहली पट्टी में गंगवार सरदारों का दबदबा था, जो कायमगंज से पीलीभीत तक फैली हुई थी। दूसरी पट्टी में कटियार सरदारों का दबदबा था, जो फर्रुखाबाद से बिठूर तक फैली हुई थी।</p>
            <p>मराठा सरदारों द्वारा बदला लेने का वर्णन विनायक दामोदर सावरकर ने अपनी पुस्तक "हिंदू-पद-पादशाही" में किया है।</p>
